# Approach 3 â€” Space & time-optimized backtracking using bitmasks.
# Uses integers to track blocked columns and diagonals; very fast for n <= 14+.
# cols, d1, d2 are bitmasks of length n (or up to 2n-1 for diagonals, but we fold by shifting).
# For each row, candidate positions are bits where none of these masks have 1s.
