Given an integer n, count the number of 1's in the binary representation of every number in the range [0, n].

Return an array output where output[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4

Output: [0,1,1,2,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 1000
