You are given a 2-D grid of integers matrix, where each integer is greater than or equal to 0.

Return the length of the longest strictly increasing path within matrix.

From each cell within the path, you can move either horizontally or vertically. You may not move diagonally.

Example 1:



Input: matrix = [[5,5,3],[2,3,6],[1,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 3, 6] or [1, 2, 3, 5].

Example 2:



Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[2,1,4],[7,6,5]]

Output: 7
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
Constraints:

1 <= matrix.length, matrix[i].length <= 100
